### ***The following sections will guide you through the process of using PathPilot.***

## üî® How It Works:

### **Step 1: Start Creating Content**

Click `üåü Start Creating Content` to begin

![start_creating_content-05.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91d228a4-b1da-4255-b563-c3f25cb0b350/53ffbc36-8a6e-4549-a202-81f816c25339/start_creating_content-05.jpg)

### **Step 2: Content Form**

PathPilot will request that you fill out the `content form`. This step is important as it frames the direction for the rest of the conversation.

- Subject (e.g., History)
- Topic (e.g., The Industrial Revolution)
- Target Demographic (e.g., 15-17 years old students)
- Learning Objectives (e.g., Understand the causes and effects of the Industrial Revolution)

![content_form-06-06.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91d228a4-b1da-4255-b563-c3f25cb0b350/66b6184f-3f7b-43ca-b37c-1c99052c4586/content_form-06-06.jpg)

### **Step 3: Transformation**

Once the user has given back the content form, PathPilot will provide a number of pathways (Q,W,E,R) to begin. Generally the "Q" pathway will start with a basic introduction so its generally  best to start with. 

![content_form-06-07.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91d228a4-b1da-4255-b563-c3f25cb0b350/539c19f7-9d7e-4ba0-acf8-a288506b8197/content_form-06-07.jpg)

### **Step 4: Section Generation**

Content will be generated according to the pathway selected, providing direct content to be incorporated into your lesson. Descriptions for multimedia and noteable keywords will be provided for potential hyperlinking or annotation needs.

## üó∫Ô∏è Understanding Path Choices:

Using our Industrial Revolution example, after transformation, content generation and path options start at the introductory stage.

![path_selection-09.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91d228a4-b1da-4255-b563-c3f25cb0b350/61a1d94d-524d-43a4-b9fb-b964bb70f557/path_selection-09.jpg)

To choose a direction, simply type the letter of your choice (Q, W, E, or R) 

### Example:

| üòé User | Types "Q" for first pathway |
| --- | --- |
| ü§ñ Pathpilot  | Generates content for the Q path: Overview of the Industrial Revolution and updates the options. |

After the selected path has been generated a new path will be generated to replace the old one.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Moving to the Next Stage:

In addition to path choices, users can move sequentially to subsequent stages. As previously mentioned, subject expert mode starts at the introductory stage.

**Stages:**

1. Introduction - Basic Concepts
2. Exploration - Expanding on Basics
3. Development - Delving Deeper
4. Integration - Synthesizing Knowledge
5. Conclusion - Summarizing and Projecting Futures

To move to the next stage, instead of responding with a pathway selection (Q, W, E, R), respond with "N".

### Example

| üòé User | Types "N" for next stage |
| --- | --- |
| ü§ñ Pathpilot  | Reactivates subject expert, switches its context to the new stage and generates a new selection of pathways.  |

The user will cycle through pathways and stages until the final stage is reached (Stage 5: Conclusion).

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

We are still identifying PathPilot's shortcomings and errors. With your help, we plan on iterating and improving the GPT to enhance the user experience.

**Notable Inconsistencies:**

1. If you experience an unusual output, dislike the response, select a reason, and regenerate. You may need to nudge PathPilot onto the right track again.
2. Sometimes, PathPilot outputs direct content in bullet form. If you prefer a different style, dislike the output, select style or format, and try to nudge it in a better direction.

We hope you do not run into too many issues while using PathPilot.

## üí° Inspiration:

PathPilot design was inspired by GPTs like ‚ÄúProfessor Synapse‚Äù, "Grimoire (Coding Assistant)", and additional research on improving AI response accuracy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:

Always check the content generated by PathPilot for accuracy and relevance. PathPilot is an AI assistant and might produce outputs that need adjustments.
